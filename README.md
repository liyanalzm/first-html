# Liyana's first ever web project :)
Keeping my source code of my first ever web project I did in school for my Web Development course.

Please bare in mind that:

1.  The styles used are very 2015-ish format. (I even used text-align: center to make my images center lol)
2.  This application is for sure not responsive oneeee
3.  I didn't know (at that time) that width cannot be static value for a lot of components.
